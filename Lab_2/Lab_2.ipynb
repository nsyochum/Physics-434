    "\n",
    "In lecture and homework we explored how the convolution can be used to calculate the probability of a sum or average. For this problem we are going to imagine that we are looking for gamma-ray sources (e.g. with the Fermi telescope). In this kind of telescope there is a background of cosmic-rays (electrons and protons, mostly) that provides a discrete noise term across the sky that precisely follows a Poisson distribution. To detect a gamma-ray source, you need to ask what is the probability that the cosmic-ray background would have given you a measurement as signal-like or more than the signal that you received.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set up the problem, assume in 1 day the average cosmic-ray background is some number X (pick someting btwn 0.5 and 10, with different values for you and your lab partner); and the average number of gamma-rays emitted by your hypothetical source is Y (pick something larger than X).\n",
    "  \n",
    "**A) Show how the probability distribution of the background changes as you integrate (sum) for more days.**"
