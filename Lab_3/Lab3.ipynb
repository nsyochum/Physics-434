    "# Lab #3: Asking a statistical question\n",
    "This week we are going to concentrate on asking a statistical question. This process always consists of two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Writing down in words very precisely what question you are trying to ask.\n",
    "2. Converting the precise english question into a mathematical expression. This often includes determining the pdf of the background (possibly including trials), and the to integral to do to obtain a probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in this lab we will assume that we know the form of the signal-free background distribution (determining a distribution from data will be next week's lab). In each of our three examples, your task will be to state the statistical question, convert it to math, then perform the associated analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem 1\n",
    "In our first example we are looking at the temperature reading (meta-data) associated with an experiment. For the experiment to work reliably, the temperature should be at around 12 Kelvin, and if we look at the data it is mostly consistent with 12 Kelvin to within the 0.4 degree precision of the thermometry and the thermal control system (standard deviation). However, there are times when the thermal control system misbehaved and the temperature was not near 12 K, and in addition there are various glitches in the thermometry that give anomalously high and low readings (the reading does not match the real temperature). We definitely want to identify and throw out all the data when the thermal control system was not working (and the temperature was truly off from nominal). While it is possible to have an error in the thermometry such that the true temperature was fine, and we just had a wonky reading, in an abundance of caution we want to throw those values out too.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this a bit concrete, we will simulate a little data. Start by simulating 100k 'good' data points assuming Gaussian fluctations, and because we are playing god adding the following 'bad' datapoints: {10., 10.3, 2.1, 0., 0., 15.6, 22.3, 12.7}\n",
    "\n",
    "### A)  So our goal is to identify bad data and throw it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Start by exploring the data you have created with appropriate plots"
